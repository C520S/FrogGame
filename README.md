# FrogGame

# Description
This is a 2D game I made myself during University.In the game you control a frog with keyboard w,s,a,d. You can jump with the frog up, down, left and right. The frog always jumps a fixed amount. For example in the Figure 1 the frog can move the distance of 13 jumps from bottom to top of the screen and from left to right.The objective of the game is to safely move your frog from its starting location in the bottom of the screen to the five safe slots in top of the screen.
